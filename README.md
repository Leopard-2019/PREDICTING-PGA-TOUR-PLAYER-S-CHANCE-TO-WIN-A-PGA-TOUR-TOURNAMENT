<h1> PREDICTING PGA TOUR PLAYER'S CHANCE TO WIN A PGA TOUR-TOURNAMENT</h1>
<p text-align= "right">
This python application using jupyter notebook predicts the chance of any pga tour player to win a tournamet using Logistic Regression as a supervized machine learning algorithm.

The current CRISP-DM Process Model for Data Mining (see Figure 1) was followed.

<h2>Business Understanding</h2>
The Business goal is  to come up with a supervized machine learning classification model, in this particular case, logistic regression was chosen. The output is bynary, meaning that a player must get 1 to have high chance to win, or 0 to have  zero chance to win.The dataset was obtained by doing web scraping in the offical website of the PGA Tour (https://www.pgatour.com/stats), which contained the statistics collected from the tournaments played since 1980. In this particular application, the statistics used were from 2011-2021, i.e., covering only 10 years span. However, the potential user can easily covered the completed span (1980-2022) is desired by using the jupyter notebook attached.
